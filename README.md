https://sathyav99.shinyapps.io/API_US_stock_prediction/

i) Home Tab
ii) Data Tab
iii) Visualization Tab
iv) Prediction Tab

i) The Home tab serves as a starting point for users to explore the features and functionality of the app. It
provides a brief overview of what the app offers and how it can assist users in their financial endeavors.
While the Home tab doesn’t directly display data or visualizations, it acts as a gateway to the Prediction,
Data, and Visualization tabs. Users can navigate to these tabs using the navigation bar to delve deeper into
stock market predictions, historical datasets, and visual representations of stock trends.
Users are encouraged to explore the various tabs to learn more about the app’s API-driven prediction tool
and how it can empower their investment decisions.

ii) In the Data tab, users can access historical datasets, summaries, and structures for the stock market data
of five prominent companies: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA.
Dataset: Users can view historical data for each of the five stocks. This includes information such as
opening and closing prices, highest and lowest prices, trading volume, and other relevant metrics over specified period. The dataset provides valuable insights into the past performance of these stocks, allowing
users to analyze trends and patterns.

Summary: The summary feature offers a concise overview of the historical data for each stock. It includes
key statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for various parameters. This summary provides users with a quick snapshot of the stock’s historical performance, facilitating
easy comparison and analysis.

Structure: The structure feature presents the organization and format of the historical data for each stock.
Users can explore the structure to understand how the data is arranged, including the names and types of
variables, as well as any additional metadata. This insight into the data structure helps users interpret the
information more effectively and aids in data manipulation and analysis.

Overall, the Data tab provides users with comprehensive access to historical stock market data for five major
companies. Whether users are conducting research, performing analysis, or seeking insights for investment
decisions, the Data tab equips them with the necessary tools and information to make informed choices in
the dynamic world of finance

iii) In the Visualization tab, users can explore various graphical representations of historical stock market
data for five prominent companies: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA. The tab offers four
types of visualizations: histogram, box plot, line plot, and scatter plot, all based on the data from the last 30
days.

Histogram: A histogram provides users with a visual representation of the distribution of a particular variable, such as stock prices or trading volume, over the past 30 days. Users can observe the frequency of
occurrence of different price ranges or volume levels, enabling them to identify patterns and trends in the
data.

Box Plot: A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, presents a graphical summary of the distribution
of a dataset. It displays key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and outliers, allowing users to assess the
central tendency and variability of the data for each stock over the past 30 days.

Line Plot: A line plot illustrates the trend of a particular variable, such as stock prices, over time. Users
can visualize the fluctuations and movements in stock prices for each of the five companies over the past 30
days, enabling them to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations with other variables.

Scatter Plot: A scatter plot displays the relationship between two variables, typically represented on the
x-axis and y-axis. Users can explore the relationship between different aspects of stock market data, such
as price versus trading volume or price versus time, for each of the five stocks over the past 30 days. This
visualization helps users identify correlations, trends, and potential outliers in the data.
Overall, the Visualization tab provides users with powerful tools for analyzing and interpreting historical
stock market data visually. Whether users are tracking price movements, assessing distribution patterns, or
exploring relationships between variables, the tab offers valuable insights to inform their investment decisions and strategies

iv) In the Prediction tab, users can access predictive insights for five prominent companies: Amazon, Apple,
Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA. The tab provides users with a plot comparing predicted values to actual values for the latest five data points, as well as a table displaying the corresponding data.
Plot: The plot offers users a visual comparison between predicted and actual values for the latest five data
points of each stock. By plotting these values on a graph, users can quickly assess the accuracy of the predictive model and identify any discrepancies or trends between predicted and actual performance. This visual
representation helps users gauge the reliability and effectiveness of the prediction algorithm in forecasting
stock trends.

Table: The table displays detailed information for the latest five data points of each stock, including date, actual values, and predicted values. Users can review this tabular data to examine the specific numerical
predictions generated by the algorithm and compare them to the actual observed values. This allows users to delve deeper into the accuracy and precision of the predictions and gain insights into the performance of
each stock over the specified time period.

Overall, the Prediction tab offers users a comprehensive view of predictive insights for five prominent companies in the stock market. By providing both visual plots and detailed tabular data, the tab empowers users
to assess the accuracy and reliability of the prediction algorithm and make informed decisions regarding their
investment strategies.
